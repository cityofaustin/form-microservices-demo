# Microservices Demo Site

[https://coa-test-form-client.herokuapp.com](https://coa-test-form-client.herokuapp.com)

This site is a demo and sandbox for the form microservices. It sends requests to the Dispatcher, which then relays them to the appropriate microservice.

It is meant to showcase functionality of the microservices by providing a configurable request to the microservices (via form submission) and rendering the server response on the page.

It is deployed on Heroku.
